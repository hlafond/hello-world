# hello-world
A repository since it said to make one, so here we go.

I want to try out coding in my downtime at work. I hope to maybe work 45minutes to an hour at it during office hours and then maybe another hour at night. That might be a bit ambitious but I want to give this a go and see if I can add this to my skill set.
